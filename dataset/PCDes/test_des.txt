It is a phlorotannin, an organic heteropentacyclic compound and an oxacycle. It derives from a phloroglucinol. 
it, also known as paracetamol cysteine or it, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as l-cysteine-s-conjugates. L-cysteine-S-conjugates are compounds containing L-cysteine where the thio-group is conjugated. it is considered to be a practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral molecule. it has been found in human liver and kidney tissues, and has also been detected in multiple biofluids, such as urine and blood. Within the cell, acetaminophen cystein is primarily located in the cytoplasm. it participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, it can be biosynthesized from NAPQI and glutathione through its interaction with the enzymes glutathione S-transferase p and glutathione S-transferase theta-1. In addition, it can be converted into acetaminophen cystein; which is catalyzed by the enzyme multidrug resistance-associated protein 1. In humans, acetaminophen cystein is involved in the acetaminophen metabolism pathway. 
it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzylisoquinolines. These are organic compounds containing an isoquinoline to which a benzyl group is attached. it exists as a solid and is considered to be practically insoluble (in water) and relatively neutral. Within the cell, oblongine is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, oblongine can be found in fruits. This makes oblongine a potential biomarker for the consumption of this food product. 
it is the 2'-O-phospho derivative of oleandomycin. It derives from an oleandomycin. It is a conjugate acid of an it(1-). 
it appears as an anticancer drug. White to slightly yellow, amorphous or crystalline powder. Sensitive to light. Odorless. pH (0.1% solution) 3.5 - 4.5. (NTP, 1992) Vincristine Sulfate is the sulfate salt of a natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Catharanthus roseus (Vinca rosea L.) with antimitotic and antineoplastic activities. Vincristine binds irreversibly to microtubules and spindle proteins in S phase of the cell cycle and interferes with the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby arresting tumor cells in metaphase. This agent also depolymerizes microtubules and may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca(2+)-activated ATPase activity; cellular respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. 
it appears as a clear colorless liquid with a pungent odor. Very toxic by ingestion, may also be toxic by skin absorption and inhalation. Vapors heavier than air. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion. 
it belongs to the class of organic compounds known as steroidal saponins. These are saponins in which the aglycone moiety is a steroid. The steroidal aglycone is usually a spirostane, furostane, spirosolane, solanidane, or curcubitacin derivative. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in fenugreek and herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. 
it is a nucleobase analogue that is uracil in which the oxo group at C-2 is replaced by a thioxo group. It has a role as an antithyroid drug and a metabolite. It is a thiocarbonyl compound and a nucleobase analogue. It derives from a uracil. it is a sulfur-containing uracil. An established antithyroid drug and highly selective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), thiouracil also covalently binds to dopaquinone, produced by tyrosinase catalyzed oxidation of tyrosine, thereby selectively accumulating in de novo-synthesized melanin in overactive melanin-producing cells and providing a means to localize melanoma cells. (NCI04) 
it is a tetrahydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide obtained by formal stereo- and regioselective hydration across the 5,6-double bond in the nicotinyl ring of NADH, with the hydroxy group located at position 6, having (S)-configuration. It is a tetrahydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and a hemiaminal. It derives from a NADH. It is a conjugate base of a it(1+). It is a conjugate acid of a it(1-). 
it is a dodecanoate ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of dodecanoic acid with the hydroxy group of dodecan-1-ol. It derives from a dodecan-1-ol.
